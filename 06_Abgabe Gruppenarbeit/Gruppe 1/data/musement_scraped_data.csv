Today, the area of Flatbush known as ‘Little Caribbean’ is home to the largest community of Caribbean descendants outside the West Indies.

In the mid-20th century, Afro-Caribbean immigrants arrived in the U.S. seeking economic opportunities, with New York City being a top destination. Many who arrived from the Caribbean settled in and around Flatbush in Brooklyn, and today the community spirit is strong.

Your National Geographic-trained guide, living and working in Little Caribbean, will lead you on a walking tour of the area to visit a variety of community hubs, absorbing the culture, listening to music, and tasting your way around some of the typical treats of the Caribbean.

Begin with a visit to a local Grenadian grocery store for fresh coconut water – bring it with you to add a splash of Caribbean rum at your next stop. Next, visit an African record store that has been in business since the 1970s, selling musical treasures from around the globe.

Your taste buds will be in for a treat as you savour spicy Jamaican patties and jerk chicken, finishing with treats from a beloved local bakery that's been a neighborhood staple for over half a century.

A huge swathe of green covering more than 340 hectares, it's known as the lungs of New York. But before the construction of Central Park in 1858, a seven-block section along the western fringe of the park was home to Seneca Village, an African American enclave which provided its residents an escape from unhealthy conditions and pervasive racism experienced in Lower Manhattan, as well as an opportunity to become property owners and build a new community.

Newspaper reports that favored the creation of the park referred to Seneca Village as a place of shanties and shacks, but archaeological evidence and documentation from the time shows it was an educated, middle-class community. While the majority of the residents were African American, the village also had a substantial population of Irish and German immigrants. This mix of residents made it a unique example of an integrated community, especially for its time, and the Village boasted churches and a school.

When the City acquired the land for Central Park through the process of ‘eminent domain,’ the residents of Seneca Village were displaced and forgotten. In the 1990s, historians rediscovered the Village, leading to an ongoing project to uncover the history of this extraordinary place.

Visit the former site of Seneca Village with your National Geographic-trained guide who will share the stories of the people who once created a community here and see the site of the archaeological digs in Central Park, uncovering this little-known history.",,0

About the Pizza: no neighborhood does pizza quite like Greenwich Village, with everything from amazing coal-fired thin crust pies, to traditional New York slices dripping with mozzarella cheese and oil, to newer ""pizzaioli"" (pizza makers), many recent immigrants from Italy, who are showcasing how pizza is cooked in their home regions in the Old Country. We have been eating pizza in the neighborhood for decades, and have scouted out 3 amazing spots to try 3 different styles of pizza. We will examine what makes each so unique, from inspiration to ingredients, to ovens.
About the Beer: drinking in Greenwich Village has always been as big a part of the culture as music, painting and writing.
