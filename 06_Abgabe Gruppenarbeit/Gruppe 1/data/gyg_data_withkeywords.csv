The Museum at Eldridge Street is housed in the historic Eldridge Street Synagogue. Built in 1887, it is an architectural marvel and a symbol of immigrant aspirations realized. The building is the first grand synagogue purpose-built by Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the United States; a landmark of the great age of immigration that would see one third of Europe’s Jewish population cross the Atlantic at the turn of the 20th century. Standing amongst the overcrowded tenements and packed city streets, the synagogue served multiple purposes. It was built as a house of worship but was also a place to build community, and a symbol that these new Lower East Side residents were laying down permanent roots in their new home. Impacted by strict 1920s immigration quotas, the building was nearly lost to neglect before the Museum’s 20-year, $20 million restoration project returned the space to glory and public use.

In this guided tour, visitors will join one of the Museum's docents for a one hour tour of the building and and learn about the rise, decline, and restoration of our historic landmark; the lives, traditions, and customs of the Lower East Side’s Jewish community; and the ways in which we are preserving this history and these stories for future generations.",5.0,2.0,Guided tour,,,,,,museum at eldridge street synagogue ; national historic landmark ; immigrant life ; architecture ; historic preservation ; grand synagogue ; eastern european immigrants ;

The Museum at Eldridge Street is housed in the historic Eldridge Street Synagogue. Built in 1887, it is an architectural marvel and a symbol of immigrant aspirations realized. The building is the first grand synagogue purpose-built by Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the United States; a landmark of the great age of immigration that would see one third of Europe’s Jewish population cross the Atlantic at the turn of the 20th century. Standing amongst the overcrowded tenements and packed city streets, the synagogue served multiple purposes. It was built as a house of worship but was also a place to build community, and a symbol that these new Lower East Side residents were laying down permanent roots in their new home. Impacted by strict 1920s immigration quotas, the building was nearly lost to neglect before the Museum’s 20-year, $20 million restoration project returned the space to glory and public use.

In this Self-Guided Museum Tour, visitors will explore the building at their own pace and learn about the rise, decline, and restoration of this historic landmark; the lives, traditions, and customs of the Lower East Side’s Jewish community; and the ways in which we are preserving this history and these stories for future generations.",,,Entry ticket,,,,,,self-guided museum tour; historic eldridge street synagogue ; historic preservation ; immigrant aspirations ; eastern european immigrants ; united states ; immigration quotas ;

It was like the Wild West, a trading outpost on the outskirts of the law where guns and ammunition were traded in exchange for beaver pelts from the Native Americans.

You will see financial and historical landmarks such as Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange, House of Morgan, the Charging Bull, as well as go inside Federal Hall and Trinity Church.
At the New York Stock Exchange building, you'll learn how a group of 24 traders wanted to formalize their trading and created the Buttonwood Agreement, which gave birth to the stock exchange.

You'll stand at the site of the first terrorist attack on New York City, which remains unsolved to this day. &nbsp;Walk along Wall Street to 40 Wall Street where your guide will share the story of the Skyscraper Race within the concrete jungle, when two buildings simultaneously being constructed to out-do one another in height takes an surprising turn.

Your guide will bring you inside Trinity Church, whose graveyard contains the remains of many great Americans: signers of the Declaration of Independence, and founding Father, Alexander Hamilton and inventor Robert Fulton. &nbsp;Hear about the political rivalry between Alexander Hamilton and Vice President of the United States Aaron Burr that came to a bloody end.

Next, you will have the chance to reflect at the 9/11 Memorial. &nbsp;Against the peaceful background sounds of the trickling water coming from Reflecting Absence waterfalls, which are built on the actual footprint of the former World Trade Center buildings, your tour guide will give an overview of the events of that day, as well as more emotional and heroic stories of the people who were involved in the attacks and immediate rescue efforts. You'll also learn about the symbolism and design of the memorial itself as well as the new WTC buildings, such as One World Trade.

For the last stretch of the tour, walk south down Broadway where you'll see the famous Charging Bull statue, Bowling Green Park, and the Canyon of Heroes. Your tour concludes in Battery Park where your guide will give an overview of our country's immigration history as you stare out the harbor towards the Statue of Liberty.

It hasn’t been dubbed “the greatest public space on earth” for nothing. And, while other tourists wander aimlessly, you’ll walk through time – marveling at true tales, meeting colorful characters and learning hidden secrets.

This walking tour starts on Fountain Terrace next to the Josephine Shaw Lowell Memorial Fountain. There, you’ll be introduced to the small green space that’s less than the size of a single city block, yet attracts over twelve million visitors per year. As you make your way to the New York Public Library where our tour ends, I’ll show you the hidden escape hatch that leads from the library to the park. You’ll also see the Empire State building and hear about the night a B-25 Bomber crashed into it. Along the way, you’ll hear about the battle in which George Washington almost lost the Revolutionary War, and how Edgar Alan Poe used to walk around Reservoir Square before it became Bryant Park.

In just over an hour, you’ll:

• Gasp at Elijah Otis’ first demonstration of the ”elevator brake” at the historic Crystal Palace
• Meet four generations of Astors: from the immigrant who rose out of poverty to the richest man to go down with the Titanic
• Re-live the heart plummeting moment a woman fell 79-stories down an elevator shaft and survived!
• Discover the most powerful force on earth at the ‘Fountain of Truth’
• Hear how NYC’s notorious ‘Needle Park’ became the most successful public space on the planet
• Take in the Gertrude Stein statue as well as the William Cullen Bryant statue, and learn how they named the wrong park after him
• Weep at the tragic tale of eccentric inventor Nikola Tesla, who fell madly in love with... a pigeon
• Decode the hidden symbolism behind the library’s statues and ornaments
• Learn how the library was born: a story of opium, cannabis and heartbreak
• Greet the library's famous lions, and call them by their original names
• Say “hullo” to the actual, original Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Kanga, Eeyore and Tigger
• Stand in awe at the scale of the Rose Reading room, perhaps America’s most inspiring interior, where knowledge is free to all
• See where Ripley’s Believe It Or Not found all its unbelievable facts
• Sit in the gorgeous periodicals room, at whose tables a visitor created the most successful magazine in history
