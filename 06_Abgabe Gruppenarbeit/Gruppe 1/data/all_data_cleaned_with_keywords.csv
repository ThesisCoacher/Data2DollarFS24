Johnson, etc. On this 10,000-step journey, we will pass several Harlem murals that capsulize Harlemâs glorious past.  We will also see where Martin Luther King spoke, suffered a near-death experience, and was hospitalized. Two places of particular interest will be   explored â the Harlem Jazz Museum (Thurs-Sat only) & the Schomburg Library for African Studies (Mon-Sat). At the Schomburg, we will see a mosaic cosmogram containing the ashes of Langston Hughes underneath it.   To round out our experience, we will walk upon Harlemâs âWalk of Fame;â and see monuments of Civil Rights trailblazers and the famous Sylviaâs Restaurant, named after the âQueen of Soul Foodâ Sylvia Woods.

Whatever your situation, this is the place to start.    Bourbon Basics is a great way to get into whiskey as a beginner, or to develop your appreciation for spirits. Each guest will learn about three different American whiskeys that I pick by getting to know you with complimentary tastings that will educate and expand your palate, ending in a final parting shot.    This is a whiskey tasting for the beginner or intermediate enthusiast. I've chosen whiskeys for hundreds of palettes and made new friends every step of the way. Through my experience you'll get insider access to my process and the tools you need to pick whiskeys of your own either when you're out at bars and the list seems impossibly long or when you're looking for a gift for that lovable snob in your life.",whiskey basics; bourbon basics; american whiskeys ; complimentary tastings ; beginner or intermediate enthusiast ; insider access ; lovable snob

If you're a fan of the HBO show The Gilded Age, you'll love this tour. During the Gilded Age New York City became home to the greatest concentration of wealth in human history. As America's new millionaires competed with each other to see who could have the most ornate mansion alongside the newly created Central Park they spent vast sums of money to hire architects inspired by European palaces to build structures the likes of which had never been seen in America. These men and women were as fascinating and complex as the homes they inhabited and we'll hear stories of power, greed, love and generosity from a time when America was quickly becoming one of the richest and most powerful countries in the world.","the gilded age mansions of fifth avenue ; new york city ; central park ; european palaces ; power, greed ; love ; generosity ; the gilded age"

There are two vastly different sides to Williamsburg: the cool, hipster part that has made the neighborhood a âmust goâ place for anyone visiting New York City, and the Orthodox Jewish community, which is a stark contrast to the young and fashionable part of Williamsburg.     During this 3-hr tour, I will introduce you to both sides of this diverse neighborhood. I will show you some of the best spots to shop, eat and drink in Williamsburg (with a focus on small, locally owned businesses), some of the most striking murals and street art, and show you one of the best Manhattan skyline views. You will get to know the best independent boutiques in Williamsburg, vintage shops, the best places to grab a coffee, and youâll know where to grab a slice of a classic New York pizza.    After an introduction to Brooklyn and learning about Williamsburgâs history, weâll move on to the lesser-known side of this neighborhood: the Hasidic Jewish community. You will learn about one the largest Orthodox Jewish communities in the world, gain a better understanding of this deeply religious group, and  get an insight on the unique traditions and customs of Hasidic Jews.","new york city, hasidic Jewish community; hasidic Jewish community; blue-collar industrial neighborhood ; trendy shops ; Manhattan skyline views ; independent boutiques"

Why Vegan soap? Because you should know what you're putting on your skin at all times.     Fact: Fragrance, Parabens, Sulfates, and Triclosan are four harmful chemicals hiding in your body soap.  Think about it. If we are washing our bodies with soap that contains harmful ingredients every single day, this adds up over a lifetime. Soap companies used to use healthier ingredients, then stopped, we'll find out why?    This is an immersive experience where you will not only learn about the art of soap making.  But you will also learn about the benefits of using natural ingredients to make vegan soap. We will discuss the different popular processes, and the main carrier oilsâolive, coconut, and palm. Closing out with the environmental impacts of soap and its use of plastic packaging.     Fact:  On average we use 7X more liquid soap than solid soap.  We use 30% more water when washing our hands with liquid soap than solid soap bars     This is a very informative experience and you will be guided patiently the entire process. You can personalize your batch by selecting from a variety of scents and herbs. We will skip the saponification process and meltdown the all-natural base.     Making soap is easy to do once you have made it with a pro. You will leave here knowing how to make your own soap, including recipes and resources.  Other things to note  The soap you create will need to cure for24 hrs before it becomes solid and ready for use. You will take the soap home with you the same day. For an extra Fee I can bring this experience to your party.

The Museum at Eldridge Street is housed in the historic Eldridge Street Synagogue. Built in 1887, it is an architectural marvel and a symbol of immigrant aspirations realized. The building is the first grand synagogue purpose-built by Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the United States; a landmark of the great age of immigration that would see one third of Europe’s Jewish population cross the Atlantic at the turn of the 20th century. Standing amongst the overcrowded tenements and packed city streets, the synagogue served multiple purposes. It was built as a house of worship but was also a place to build community, and a symbol that these new Lower East Side residents were laying down permanent roots in their new home.

The streets are filled with classic slice shops, tiny Neapolitan eateries, and creative new angles on century-old techniques.

As you walk - and your guide fills you up with pizza knowledge - stop at 3 pizzerias, each specializing in a different stage of the pie's development from a humble Neapolitan street food to a celebrated American staple. Spend time with the owners and <em>pizzaioli</em> (pizza makers) to learn some of the tricks of the trade.

Beyond learning about ancient pizza toppings and dough stretching techniques, compare the baking patterns of 3 different pizza ovens.

There’s so much going on it’s hard to know where to look.

On this walking tour, I’ll guide you from Father Duffy Square to the Empire Theater on 42nd Street, pointing out the details most visitors miss. I’ll show you hidden artwork and iconic filming locations. You’ll also see the exact spots where a famous kiss and a legendary murder occurred. I’ll share the fascinating backstories behind the buildings and theaters we pass, including the Knickerbocker and Casablanca Hotels, Paramount Building, New Victory Theater, New Amsterdam Theatre, Liberty Theater and Empire Theatre. Plus I’ll introduce you to the larger-than-life characters who left their mark here.

Along the way, you’ll:

• Be dazzled by the history of Time Square’s lights, from the search lights that signaled Teddy Roosevelt’s election and the “zipper” that announced war’s end, to the theater marquees that made this the “Great White Way” and the famous New Year’s Eve “Ball Drop”
• Find the often overlooked Liberty Theatre where Birth Of A Nation premiered, directly inspiring lynchings and the revival of Ku Klux Klan
• Spot the Naked Cowboy and get a brief history of the man behind the strategically placed guitar
• Experience the gangland murder of ”Beansie” Rosenthal which led to the ""Trial of the Century,"" and sent Charles Becker to the electric chair, becoming the only cop in history to be executed
• Meet Father Duffy, the heroic battlefield priest who braved machine gun fire to comfort the wounded, and became a hero in New York’s toughest neighborhood
• Stand at the start of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across America
• Be thrilled by the tale of the hapless burglars who tried to shoot it out with NYC cops, using squirt guns filled with Tabasco Sauce
• Walk along 42nd Street, once the most dangerous and decadent block in New York City, now home to a Disney theater
• Learn how the New Victory Theater evolved from a stage for serious drama, to New York’s last burlesque house, then into its first porn theater, only to become an abandoned wreck for many years before being reborn into the now famous children’s theater
• See where thousands of teens swooned for Sinatra and screamed for the Beatles
• Discover how the Tony Awards got their name
