Along with expert narration, this tour covers key pivotal moments with vivid photos capturing the emotions and valor of this cityâs first responders.     The second portion of this package is an entry ticket into the 9/11 Museum for a self-guided experience. The 9/11 Museum leisurely takes 2 hours to explore, featuring recovered artifacts from the attacks. It also provides a wealth of recorded information from survivors who were in the towers.

Tending to our own being is the only activism we have real power in.     Formerly a traditional activist, in light of the political expression of the world of 2020, Sfera turned inward, using the tools gleaned from a lifetime of art to hone her skills for navigating the turbulent waters of our time.

During this 3-hr tour, I will introduce you to both sides of this diverse neighborhood. I will show you some of the best spots to shop, eat and drink in Williamsburg (with a focus on small, locally owned businesses), some of the most striking murals and street art, and show you one of the best Manhattan skyline views. You will get to know the best independent boutiques in Williamsburg, vintage shops, the best places to grab a coffee, and youâll know where to grab a slice of a classic New York pizza.

A pocket sketchbook is included!    We meet in the magnificent Grand Central Terminal, where we'll kick off with introductions & engaging warm-up sketching exercises to ignite your creativity. From there, we'll sketch our way through the terminal & its surroundings, & weather permitting, continue the exploration up to the NYC Public Library.    This is not a technical drawing class, but a way of using drawing to more fully experience & reflect on the visual energy of NYC. When we sketch we engage with what we see in fresh & exciting ways. Sketching allows us to pause, step back, & observe. It is a reflective experience that enlivens the senses & connects you with the source of your own creativity.    Ideal for solo adventurers, couples, teams, & groups of all kinds!    I also host the online experience 'Drawn from Within'. Both experiences are excellent for fostering creativity & team cohesion. Feel free to reach out for more information.    While the scheduled duration is 1.5 hours, I'm usually flexible & can extend it up to 2 hours based on group preferences.    I look forward to sketching with you soon!",sketching adventure ; midtown Manhattan ; local artist ; pocket sketchbook ; technical drawing class ; reflective experience ; team cohesion ; online experience ;

One of the murders has a bizarre occult/satanic backstory - which I'm able to relate in detail as I lived for a decade in the building where this murder occurred. (I was one of only 2 people who were interviewed by The New York Times for an article about this murder - regarding a sanity \""re-determination\"" hearing for the culprit.) We will NOT discuss any Mafia \""hits\"" or other gangland crimes (yawn)...nor will we discuss any musty olde Gangs of New York-era crimes - this is not that tour. For each of the murders we'll discuss, I've gone well beyond standard research  and dug up surprising details buried in the actual case files, forgotten magazine articles, out-of-print books, and other resources. Please join me for a walk around the gritty city as we revisit a pre-gentrification New York - a city where anything could happen - and often did.  *****  Please note:   1.

Why Vegan soap? Because you should know what you're putting on your skin at all times.     Fact: Fragrance, Parabens, Sulfates, and Triclosan are four harmful chemicals hiding in your body soap.

But you will also learn about the benefits of using natural ingredients to make vegan soap. We will discuss the different popular processes, and the main carrier oilsâolive, coconut, and palm. Closing out with the environmental impacts of soap and its use of plastic packaging.     Fact:  On average we use 7X more liquid soap than solid soap.  We use 30% more water when washing our hands with liquid soap than solid soap bars     This is a very informative experience and you will be guided patiently the entire process. You can personalize your batch by selecting from a variety of scents and herbs. We will skip the saponification process and meltdown the all-natural base.     Making soap is easy to do once you have made it with a pro. You will leave here knowing how to make your own soap, including recipes and resources.

However, local residents and visitors don't always have easy access to basic information regarding any given work of art, such as artist biography, artistic motivation, or how the content and graffiti style relate to local architecture and the community's rich past. This carefully curated and independently researched walking tour is designed to provide greater context surrounding key works of contemporary art while introducing guests to local establishments. Whether youâre a native New Yorker looking to find out more about the public art you walk past every day or a tourist in town looking for a less conventional excursion, this 1.5-hour tour offers in-depth information presented in a fun, engaging way. Unlike other tours, we'll be focusing on a small number of murals, allowing us to dissect the symbolism and meaning as a group. Great for corporate teams and group outings.
