Discover a place which changes our relationship with cities, environment, and ourselves through immersive, multi-sensory experiences.</p><p>
</p><p>Head off the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal, to learn the&nbsp;story behind its creation. Learn all about an attraction designed with the intention of transcending everyday existence, and engage with space in a fascinating new way.

Begin with a sensory stimulating elevator ride to the 91st floor. Be transported into SUMMIT AIR, a new way to see and interact with space designed by Kenzo Digital. Layered with two floors of floor to ceiling mirrors, AIR offers a new perspective as the Manhattan skyline reflects all around you.

Next, test your limits at SUMMIT LEVITATION and enjoy the rush of stepping out over the city on two glass ledges suspended 1,063 feet above Madison Avenue. Watch your image float in the clouds across a multi-media screen and get in touch with your playful side in the silver balloon AFFINITY room.

Once you reach the 93rd floor, take in the sights and sounds of NYC from another vantage point on the outdoor observation deck.</p><p>
</p><p>For a more intimate, adult-friendly evening experience, choose to visit SUMMIT during Air at Night. Guests can enjoy access to all areas of the attraction, an LED light show with accompanying vivacious music, and cocktails for purchase at the 93rd floor bar.</p>",4.7 ,,,,,,,
